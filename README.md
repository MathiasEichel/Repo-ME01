# Getting Started

This is our CAP example project with GitHub support.

It will demonstrate reading Product Master Data from different SAP Systems and persist the data.
This is for having a common data model

Context for CAP training

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

// new table
clm 1 | clm 2
-------|-------
Text 1 | Text 2

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Next Steps

- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch` 
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)
- Start adding content, for example, a [db/schema.cds](db/schema.cds).
